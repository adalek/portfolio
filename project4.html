            <p>The project was inspired by Lifeline-Zeraphym and Sturm I - Fear. The former using music and heartbeat sound to create an atmosphere that seems to tell a sad/hopeful story, the latter combines rapid piano with interest sound effects and play progressive melody repeatedly.
            </p>
            <p>Making music is more like natural flow than meticulous design but I do want to show different emotion phases during the composition and to have a metaphor on lifeâ€™s quietness, pain, struggle, strength, beauty and blossom. I am not able to fully develop my idea within the limited time but I tried to make a minimalist visual of the transformation of a single line to represent different emotional stage of life.</p>

            <p>I started the project with making some random beats. I didn't expect to make it musical at all not only because I didn't want to but also because I thought it was hard to write a melody without thorough musical theory knowledge. I wrote a short melody of 4 or 6 notes as practice and found it sounded good after adding more notes and double it. Neither, I didn't expect to use piano because it is not my taste of music and "superpiano" doesn't sound good. However, after I wrote a melody and its chords I found the pitch would be different using other synthesizers, so I kept the superpiano because I had to find out the proper chord again otherwise. Magically, when the gain was assigned with a certain number, superpiano sounded fine. That is basically the full story of the composition style. I added the heartbeat-like beat and then I added a simulated electrocardiogram machine sound. Also, I don't want my composition sounds happy. I wrote a chord that sounded very joyful at first. Hopefully, the final result was at least less happy than that. As for the visual, my computer felt much stressful with hydra. It stopped functioning frequently and I also didn't spend as much time on the visual as on the sound, but I did accomplish my idea of making visuals with a line. I would like to explore more with this kind of simple or minimal style.</p>
